Built using **tensorflow** and **scikit-learn**.

### Documentation and performance
The model is able to recognise anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.
Check the jupyter notebooks in documentation for infos about the model, how it was trained and optimized and how
it performs with several scores and nice visualizations.

### Real time expression recognition
